# Explainable-AI-for-Fraud-Transaction-Detection

Business Problem:
In the process of detecting fraudulent claims, companies face the challenge of balancing
the costs and risks associated with false negatives (fraudulent claims mistakenly identified
as legitimate) and false positives (legitimate claims incorrectly flagged as fraudulent).
This over-sensitivity is primarily due to the model's inability to handle highly imbalanced
data (where non-fraudulent claims far outnumber fraudulent ones) and the high cost
associated with missing actual fraudulent claims (false negatives).
The company needs a solution that not only improves the accuracy of fraud detection but
also provides clear explanations for its decisions, enabling fraud analysts to efficiently
review and understand the reasoning behind each flagged claim.
